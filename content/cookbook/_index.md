Here we will try to show practical information, recipes and examples of various subjects.

<!-- Programming languages are user interfaces, powerfull, composable, scriptable, and the users might be specific, but still user interfaces. -->

<!-- As a programming languages become higher and higher level, border between programming languages and a user interfaces would start blurring. 
At a high level program could be seen as very flexible, composable, serializable user interface.

Program composition is a process of translating from computation verbiage and data structures to the problem domain verbiage and structures, and at the end the end-user verbiage.

In Rye we try to explore these things. For a language to be higher level than what we're used to it also needs higher level (closer to problem/human) data structures.  -->

<!-- Programming is translating from computer domain to user / problem domain (or reverse). Rye works closer to the user / problem domain. -->

<!-- Rye also tries to be good tool for describing the problem, not just defining steps to solution. When the problem is well declared, working and improving path to solution is easier. -->
